      <h2>The Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">A</span>s tech moves forward, we will be generating more and more data online. As it
        currently is,
        tech giants are collecting oceans of data about their user and using personal user‚Äôs data to increase their
        revenues.
        Trying to counteract the efforts of these giants to fish users‚Äô data will always lead to failure.
        However, users must be granted control of their own data.
        Therefore, we want to allow users to willingly sell their data by creating an online marketplace for data.
      </p>
      <h2>The Research</h2>
      <p>
        Designing an application to be used by the wide public is one of the hardest tasks a UX designer will encounter
        during their career.
        Especially when the application touches a very sensitive subject such as private user data.
        To make sure our personas would be accurate to the feelings of the public we opted for methods that would reach
        as many people as possible and as closely as possible.
        Therefore, we chose to send surveys and run interviews.
      </p>
      <h3>Surveys</h3>
      <h3>Interviews</h3>
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        After doing a long analysis of our data, we found four archetypes of users of our application.
        They were categorized by the following characteristics. Our first persona ‚ÄúJessica Kwan‚Äù knows plenty of her
        data is already being collected by companies and would gladly enjoy another service from her data.
        The second persona ‚ÄúAndrew Johnson‚Äù would enjoy selling his data to gain a little extra time with his family
        however, he is concerned by data leaks and privacy of his information.
        The third persona ‚ÄúCharles Mansfield‚Äù would sell for data, but for something other than dollars since the little
        income from selling his data would be negligible to his finances.
        The last persona, ‚ÄúPierre Jean‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt like to sell his data for money, but would love to donate his data to
        researchers to benefit society.
      </p>
      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>
        In order to roughly visualize the final product, we created high-level skecthes to give us more insight on the
        feeling of the app design.

      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">W</span>eb Typography obsessed me. As many others,
        I fell in the trap of optimizing legibility. Definitly not an easy task.<br>Among all the contenders for the
        best reading experience on the Web, a name is
        always present and noteworthy: <strong>Medium.com</strong> .
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking for the arcane secrets that regulates good legibility, I immediately realized
        that I needed to follow in the footsteps of the masters. So I started dissecting the rules that
        makes <strong>Medium</strong> typography, well, great.
      </p>
      <p>There were long hours of <strong>tremendous effort</strong>, days and days of <strong>prolonged
          pains</strong>...</p>
      <blockquote>Now I want to share with you the results of those long hours ü¶ã</blockquote>
      <h2>An unexpected journey</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">C</span>omes out that nothing is better than a big first letter to super-charge your
        style.
        Rules are simples. A big letter that spans exactly two rows. Play with <code>line-height</code> to get it right.
      </p>
      <h2>The hero</h2>
      <p>We all know who the leader is.<br>When designing a website you have to take into account fonts for three
        sectors: the <strong>content</strong>, the <strong>UI</strong>, the <strong>brand</strong>.<br>Specifically I
        found that the best free alternatives <i>(Google Fonts)</i> to the handcrafted fonts that
        <strong>Medium</strong> uses are respectively <span class="highlighted">Lora</span>,
        <span class="highlighted">Montserrat</span> and <span class="highlighted">Playfair Display</span>. <br>I
        discovered with delight that the last one mimics almost perfectly the effect created especially for
        <code>blockquote</code>.
      </p>
      <h2>Content font</h2>
      <p>
        The content font should be a serif one, to gently bring your eyes from one letter to the other with
        the lowest amount of effort.<br><code>line-height</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code> are vital here. Play
        with those parameters to make the most out of your
        font of choice. However at <strong>Medium</strong> you'll find almost an empty line of space in the middle of
        two lines of text (<code>line-height: 1.58;</code>).
        While the space between the charachters is kept a little bit on the negative side
        (<code>letter-spacing: -0.03;</code>) to make words feel more compacts.
      </p>
      <h2>Brand font</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this font is to enforce the presence of our brand during the navigation experience.
        We can use it for titles and, here and there, for some minutiae.
      </p>
      <blockquote>Blockquotes, for example ü§´</blockquote>
      <h2>UI font</h2>
      <p>
        The font used for all the UI elements is preferably a sans-serif one. It should create contrast with the content
        font.
        Its color could be a little bit lighter than the one used for the main content. <br>It needs to be readable
        given the background-color of your page
        but not distracting from the main purpose of the page. <span class="highlighted">Reading!</span><br>You can use
        it also for <code>h2</code> making the titles for your paragraphs. Here the color should be the same as the one
        used for the main title.
      </p>
      <h2><span class="highlighted">The highlight</span></h2>
      <p>To highlight a word or phrase you can wrap them in a <code>span</code> element and <span
          class="highlighted">set the background to a color that reminds of your brand color identity</span>.</p>
      <h1>Every Title</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">`Needs a subtitle`</p>
      <p>Here we find <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)</code> to give meaningful informations without grabbing the attention
        that the title, main charachter, deserves.</p>
      <h2>The length</h2>
      <p class="lineLength">
        The length of a line of text should never be longer than <code>740px</code>. So our eyes are not forced to run
        from left to right on the page. </p>
      <h2>The color</h2>
      <p>
        The text color should be <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84)</code> on a <code>rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)</code> background to
        ensure the best contrast possible.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>As always, the strict first rule of design is that there are no strict rules.<br>But, if you are in trouble...
