      <h1>Take Back Control Of Your Data</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>The Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">A</span>s tech moves forward, we will be generating more and more data online. As it
        currently is, tech giants are collecting oceans of data about their user and using personal user’s data to
        increase their revenues. Trying to counteract the efforts of these giants to fish users’ data will always lead
        to failure. However, users must be granted control of their own data. Therefore, we want to allow users to
        willingly sell their data by creating an online marketplace for data.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Research</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">D</span>esigning an application to be used by the wide public is one of the hardest
        tasks a UX designer will encounter
        during their career. Especially when the application touches a very sensitive subject such as private user data.
        To ensure that our personas would accurately represent the feelings of the public, we opted for methods that
        would reach as many people, as closely as possible. Therefore, we chose to send surveys and run interviews.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Surveys</h3>
      <p>The survey we created was administered through a google form and distributed to our user population using
        popular social medias and messaging platforms, as a means to collect data from the masses. Since surveys are
        easy to distribute and quicker to complete than in-person interviews, a large set of data could be gathered
        rapidly and would provide direct responses to our design and implementation questions. After analyzing the data
        from the surveys, we noticed the following factors.
        The vast majority of the user population worried about data privacy. Thus, the security of users’ data and their
        feeling of control over it was a main focus for our design moving on. Furthermore, we also realized that, while
        53.9% of the surveyed population would not agree to sell their data, a good majority of said portion would sell
        their data under certain conditions. The most prevalent reason to not sell their data was the risk of data
        leaks. In consequence, we decided to add a disclaimer on all offers on our website would don a disclaimer
        specifying that all buyers need to abide by our data storing compliance.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Interviews</h3>
      <p>We opted to run two types of interviews : long in-depth interviews and shallow interviews in a vox pop form.
        The long and in-depth interviews were used to extract precise information and meaningful concerns from
        individuals on the potentials and pitfalls of a data marketplace platform. We recognized that many people with
        varying traits and backgrounds will voice distinct and personal opinions on the success of this platform which
        is invaluable to developers.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <p>
        After scrutinizing our data, we were able to generate four user archetypes who would accurately represent our
        surveyed population and be interested in using our application. These personas vary in age, gender, ethnicity,
        career, and personalities, providing us with a wide range of traits which need to be pleased if they were to use
        our platform.
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Jessica Kwan</u>
        <br>
        Jessica is very in touch with her online personal data and is aware that it is already being collected by large
        corporations. This being said, she would gladly offer companies her data in exchange for money as a way to lend
        her hand through her young adulthood. She is mildly concerned that her identity is a risk and doesn’t worry that
        her collected data could be used against her.
        <br>
        <br>
        She is “The Opportunist”.

          <u>Pierre Jean</u>
          <br>
          Pierre is against making a profit by selling his data. Instead, he would love to donate it to researchers in
          order to benefit society. He is against all large corporations turning a profit of the backs of their innocent
          consumers and would be hypocritical if he sold them his data. As an academic, Pierre loves research and
          lending himself to studies in the hopes of aiding in a new discovery or breakthrough. Thus, in his eye, his
          data is most valuable to fellow academics who grapple to collect enough meaningful data to conduct their
          studies.
          <br>
          <br>
          He is “The Benefactor”.

          Andrew would consider selling his data but is uneasy with the idea that his personal information would be
          floating around. Andrew is a family man and loves spending time with his beloved. If he can be guaranteed that
          his data is safe and not used for malicious intent, he would sell it in in the hopes of receiving cash or
          travel discounts in order to go on a getaway with his family.

          Mansfield is not particularly concerned with data privacy but would not benefit from selling his data for cash
          since the little income from selling his data would be negligible in comparison to his finances. He, instead,
          is looking for tangible goods or services in exchange for his personal data.

      <h2>User Journeys</h2>
      <p>Making user journeys allowed us to flesh out the user experience of our product. This implies acquiring a
        better understanding of the flow of events in which our personas participate in when using the data marketplace
        platform.This UX design tool allowed us to identify our personas’ moments of discomfort, i.e. pain points, while
        interacting with our platform.
        <br><br>
        Jessica was annoyed by the inability to sell her data to multiple offers at once. Therefore, this pain point was
        addressed in further iterations of our design by adding a “sell to all button”.
        <br><br>
        Charles’ biggest gripe with the platform was the difficulty to find offers with rewards rather than cash. This
        pain point was rectified by allowing users to specify the types of rewards they wished to receive upon signing
        up for the application. Moreover, a search bar on the “My Offers” page. These UI/UX elements also solved
        Pierre’s pain point of being unable to find research-type offers.
        <br><br>
        Pierre’s irritated by the fact that he couldn’t filter out the data requests submitted by large corporations.
        This pain point was also solved by allowing users to provide a list of “blacklisted” companies as well as a
        “block this company” button within detailed offers’ pages should unwanted companies slip his mind.
        <br><br>
        Andrew was most displeased with ???

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>In order to roughly visualize the final product, we created high-level sketches to give us more insight and
        feeling for the app design. At this stage in the design, we started making strong decisions about the layout of
        our application. For instance, we established that the offers would take the form of a list of cards. Moreover,
        we established the several main views that our users would be interacting with. Although these were preliminary,
        there were the foundation of the design as a whole.</p>
      <img class="inline-image" src="./images/sketches.svg" />
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Wireframes & User Flow</h2>
      <p>The wireframe is a skeleton of the application which allowed us to further concretize the layout and flow of
        operation of our application. At this stage, UI and styling was still not our main focus but rather the user’s
        interaction with the platform.
        We took the previously made sketches and created the different views containing very basic shapes. Once that was
        completed, we linked the views together in order to map out the typical interactions our personas encounter
        while searching for offers.
      </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Color Palette</h2>
      <p>Before attempting to create our first mockups, we spent a significant amount of time debating the best choice
        of
        color to use for this type of application. Since personal data is a sensitive topic, we opted to choose few
        colors
        and soft colors in order to ease the user in and provide them with a sense of comfort while navigating the
        platform. The application’s colors are dark blue, peach, and black as seen above.</p>
      <img class="inline-image" src="./images/color palette.svg" />
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>imilarly to the color palette, we decided to avoid harsh lettering in order to appease the user and make them
        feel comfortable. We chose 2 fonts to use within our application.
        <br>
        <br>
        The “Rubik” font was chosen for the text seen on the display. It is a modern yet approachable font.
        <br>
        <br>
        The “Source sans” was chosen for the main text seen throughout the application in order to provide extra
        sophistication over the “Rubik” font, while still remaining easy to read.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Mockups</h2>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        Prototyping was the last step of our interaction design process. 
        In this stage we can experience the full UI and UX design of our application. 
        The typical user flow can be experienced with the prototype and goes as follows. 
        For instance, from the offers page, the current prototype shows the expected behavior with the Nike offer. 
        It also shows the search functionality, where a user might want to type in ‘Apple’ and select the Apple company offers. 
        The prototype also shows the signup process, and the menu tab which allows for a consistent app navigation.
        Lastly, the prototype also shows the initial “profiling” process of the users, from establishing the user’s preferences to connecting their design platforms.  
      </p>
      <iframe style="border: none;" width="800" height="800"

        allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        Two functionalities are not included in the prototype. The first is the ability to click on the RBC and Apple cards from the “My Offers” page, currently only the Nike card is functional. 
        The second is the “account settings" menu item from the hamburger menu is not currently clickable, the real button would open a browser to lead to an accounts settings page on ShareSeed’s portal.

      <!-- <div style="height: 2000px;">
      </div>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">W</span>eb Typography obsessed me. As many others,
        I fell in the trap of optimizing legibility. Definitly not an easy task.<br>Among all the contenders for the
        best reading experience on the Web, a name is
        always present and noteworthy: <strong>Medium.com</strong> .
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking for the arcane secrets that regulates good legibility, I immediately realized
        that I needed to follow in the footsteps of the masters. So I started dissecting the rules that
        makes <strong>Medium</strong> typography, well, great.
      </p>
      <p>There were long hours of <strong>tremendous effort</strong>, days and days of <strong>prolonged
          pains</strong>...</p>
      <blockquote>Now I want to share with you the results of those long hours 🦋</blockquote>
      <h2>An unexpected journey</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">C</span>omes out that nothing is better than a big first letter to super-charge your
        style.
        Rules are simples. A big letter that spans exactly two rows. Play with <code>line-height</code> to get it right.
      </p>
      <h2>The hero</h2>
      <p>We all know who the leader is.<br>When designing a website you have to take into account fonts for three
        sectors: the <strong>content</strong>, the <strong>UI</strong>, the <strong>brand</strong>.<br>Specifically I
        found that the best free alternatives <i>(Google Fonts)</i> to the handcrafted fonts that
        <strong>Medium</strong> uses are respectively <span class="highlighted">Lora</span>,
        <span class="highlighted">Montserrat</span> and <span class="highlighted">Playfair Display</span>. <br>I
        discovered with delight that the last one mimics almost perfectly the effect created especially for
        <code>blockquote</code>.
      </p>
      <h2>Content font</h2>
      <p>
        The content font should be a serif one, to gently bring your eyes from one letter to the other with
        the lowest amount of effort.<br><code>line-height</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code> are vital here. Play
        with those parameters to make the most out of your
        font of choice. However at <strong>Medium</strong> you'll find almost an empty line of space in the middle of
        two lines of text (<code>line-height: 1.58;</code>).
        While the space between the charachters is kept a little bit on the negative side
        (<code>letter-spacing: -0.03;</code>) to make words feel more compacts.
      </p>
      <h2>Brand font</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this font is to enforce the presence of our brand during the navigation experience.
        We can use it for titles and, here and there, for some minutiae.
      </p>
      <blockquote>Blockquotes, for example 🤫</blockquote>
      <h2>UI font</h2>
      <p>
        The font used for all the UI elements is preferably a sans-serif one. It should create contrast with the content
        font.
        Its color could be a little bit lighter than the one used for the main content. <br>It needs to be readable
        given the background-color of your page
        but not distracting from the main purpose of the page. <span class="highlighted">Reading!</span><br>You can use
        it also for <code>h2</code> making the titles for your paragraphs. Here the color should be the same as the one
        used for the main title.
      </p>
      <h2><span class="highlighted">The highlight</span></h2>
      <p>To highlight a word or phrase you can wrap them in a <code>span</code> element and <span
          class="highlighted">set the background to a color that reminds of your brand color identity</span>.</p>
      <h1>Every Title</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">`Needs a subtitle`</p>
      <p>Here we find <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)</code> to give meaningful informations without grabbing the attention
        that the title, main charachter, deserves.</p>
      <h2>The length</h2>
      <p class="lineLength">
        The length of a line of text should never be longer than <code>740px</code>. So our eyes are not forced to run
        from left to right on the page. </p>
      <h2>The color</h2>
      <p>
        The text color should be <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84)</code> on a <code>rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)</code> background to
        ensure the best contrast possible.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>As always, the strict first rule of design is that there are no strict rules.<br>But, if you are in trouble...
