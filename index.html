      <h1>Take Back Control Of Your Data</h1>
      <h4>By Thomas Gauvin, Jacob Guirguis, François LaBerge</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">A</span>s tech moves forward, we will be generating more and more data online. As it
        currently is, tech giants are collecting oceans of data about their user and using personal user’s data to
        increase their revenues. Trying to counteract the efforts of these giants to fish users’ data will always lead
        to failure. However, users must be granted control of their own data. Therefore, we want to allow users to
        willingly sell their data by creating an online marketplace for data.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Research</h2>
      <p>
        Designing an application to be used by the wide public is one of the hardest
        tasks a UX designer will encounter
        during their career. Especially when the application touches a very sensitive subject such as private user data.
        To ensure that our personas would accurately represent the feelings of the public, we opted for methods that
        would reach as many people, as closely as possible. Therefore, we chose to send surveys and run interviews.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Surveys</h3>
      <p>The survey we created was administered through a google form and distributed to our user population using
        popular social medias and messaging platforms, as a means to collect data from the masses. Since surveys are
        easy to distribute and quicker to complete than in-person interviews, a large set of data could be gathered
        rapidly and would provide direct responses to our design and implementation questions. After analyzing the data
        from the surveys, we noticed the following factors.
        The vast majority of the user population worried about data privacy. Thus, the security of users’ data and their
        feeling of control over it was a main focus for our design moving on. Furthermore, we also realized that, while
        53.9% of the surveyed population would not agree to sell their data, a good majority of said portion would sell
        their data under certain conditions. The most prevalent reason to not sell their data was the risk of data
        leaks. In consequence, we decided to add a disclaimer on all offers on our website would don a disclaimer
        specifying that all buyers need to abide by our data storing compliance.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Interviews</h3>
      <p>We opted to run two types of interviews : long in-depth interviews and shallow interviews in a vox pop form.
        The long and in-depth interviews were used to extract precise information and meaningful concerns from
        individuals on the potentials and pitfalls of a data marketplace platform. We recognized that many people with
        varying traits and backgrounds will voice distinct and personal opinions on the success of this platform which
        is invaluable to developers.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        After scrutinizing our data, we were able to generate four user archetypes who would accurately represent our
        surveyed population and be interested in using our application. These personas vary in age, gender, ethnicity,
        career, and personalities, providing us with a wide range of traits which need to be pleased if they were to use
        our platform.
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Jessica Kwan</u>
        <br>
        Jessica is very in touch with her online personal data and is aware that it is already being collected by large
        corporations. This being said, she would gladly offer companies her data in exchange for money as a way to lend
        her hand through her young adulthood. She is mildly concerned that her identity is a risk and doesn’t worry that
        her collected data could be used against her.
        <br>
        <br>
        She is “The Opportunist”.

          Pierre is against making a profit by selling his data. Instead, he would love to donate it to researchers in
          order to benefit society. He is against all large corporations turning a profit of the backs of their innocent
          consumers and would be hypocritical if he sold them his data. As an academic, Pierre loves research and
          lending himself to studies in the hopes of aiding in a new discovery or breakthrough. Thus, in his eye, his
          data is most valuable to fellow academics who grapple to collect enough meaningful data to conduct their
          studies.
          <br>
          <br>
          He is “The Benefactor”.

          floating around. Andrew is a family man and loves spending time with his beloved. If he can be guaranteed that
          his data is safe and not used for malicious intent, he would sell it in in the hopes of receiving cash or
          travel discounts in order to go on a getaway with his family.

          since the little income from selling his data would be negligible in comparison to his finances. He, instead,
          is looking for tangible goods or services in exchange for his personal data.

      <h2>User Journeys</h2>
      <p>Making user journeys allowed us to flesh out the user experience of our product. This implies acquiring a
        better understanding of the flow of events in which our personas participate in when using the data marketplace
        platform.This UX design tool allowed us to identify our personas’ moments of discomfort, i.e. pain points, while
        interacting with our platform.
        <br><br>
        Jessica was annoyed by the inability to sell her data to multiple offers at once. Therefore, this pain point was
        addressed in further iterations of our design by adding a “sell to all button”.
        <br><br>
        Charles’ biggest gripe with the platform was the difficulty to find offers with rewards rather than cash. This
        pain point was rectified by allowing users to specify the types of rewards they wished to receive upon signing
        up for the application. Moreover, a search bar on the “My Offers” page. These UI/UX elements also solved
        Pierre’s pain point of being unable to find research-type offers.
        <br><br>
        Pierre’s irritated by the fact that he couldn’t filter out the data requests submitted by large corporations.
        This pain point was also solved by allowing users to provide a list of “blacklisted” companies as well as a
        “block this company” button within detailed offers’ pages should unwanted companies slip his mind.
        <br><br>
        Andrew was most displeased with the uncertainty of the safety and security of his data when selling it through
        the application. This pain point was resolved by inserting a disclaimer section on every offer card explaining
        in detail how the company is to take care and ensure the security of the users’ information. Each company must
        adhere to those safety standards before advertising any offers.

      <h2>Application Concept</h2>
      <p>We decided to call the application ShareSeed. We decided on this name because we wanted to explain the
        application while easing the concerns of the users. The word “Share” indicates the action of sharing the data
        with other entities. We decided to use the word “Share” because through our user research, we noticed that
        people had an aversion to the idea of “selling data”, for concerns of dignity and “selling out oneself”.
        <br>
        <br>
        In our application, every company would submit a request for data, stating the purpose, the compensation and the
        data requested. These requests would then be sent to the user, based on the data they entered and their other
        preferences. These requests were displayed to a user individually through a list, and we called the requests
        “Offers”. This frames the request for data as a voluntary action that the user can opt in to be compensated for
        their sharing of their data. The reason for displaying these offers individually is because we noticed that
        every user had a different preference regarding the data shares, and every user wanted to review the terms of
        the sharing of the data. Therefore, each offer is able to be inspected in the Offer Page.
        <br>
        <br>
        An important aspect of the Offer Page is the full transparency section. In this section, we display the full
        data that the user is sending to the company as part of the data sharing. This appeases the concerns of the
        user. The Offer Page also states the full purpose for the data share.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Rewards section in the setting pane allows users of the application to keep a tab on all previous
        transactions. Upon entering the rewards view, the user will be greeted with an orange tree which will
        dynamically grow based on how many transactions they have made. Below the tree will the user’s previous
        transactions sorted in reverse chronological order.

      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>In order to roughly visualize the final product, we created high-level sketches to give us more insight and
        feeling for the app design. At this stage in the design, we started making strong decisions about the layout of
        our application. For instance, we established that the offers would take the form of a list of cards. Moreover,
        we established the several main views that our users would be interacting with. Although these were preliminary,
        there were the foundation of the design as a whole.</p>
      <img class="inline-image" src="./images/sketches.svg" />
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>A Few Design Decisions</h3>
      <p>During the sketch phase, we established that the offers would take the form of a list of cards. This would
        ensure that the offers are displayed as users would expect. This display format also makes the offers easy to
        browse, search and filter. We also decided that navigation within the application would take place through a
        “Hamburger” menu to the left side of the application. We decided to opt for this type of menu as it is prevalent
        in North American and European markets, where data privacy is a concern. This menu is accessible from any page
        referenced by the menu. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Wireframes & User Flow</h2>
      <p>The wireframe is a skeleton of the application which allowed us to further concretize the layout and flow of
        operation of our application. At this stage, UI and styling was still not our main focus but rather the user’s
        interaction with the platform.
        We took the previously made sketches and created the different views containing very basic shapes. Once that was
        completed, we linked the views together in order to map out the typical interactions our personas encounter
        while searching for offers.
      </p>
      <img class="inline-image" src="./images/wireframes/wireframe_Final_SVG.svg" />
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Color Palette</h2>
      <p>Before attempting to create our first mockups, we spent a significant amount of time debating the best choice
        of
        color to use for this type of application. Since personal data is a sensitive topic, we opted to choose few
        colors
        and soft colors in order to ease the user in and provide them with a sense of comfort while navigating the
        platform. The application’s colors are dark blue, peach, and black as seen above.</p>
      <img class="inline-image" src="./images/color palette.svg" />
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>imilarly to the color palette, we decided to avoid harsh lettering in order to appease the user and make them
        feel comfortable. We chose 2 fonts to use within our application.
        <br>
        <br>
        The <strong>“Rubik”</strong> font was chosen for the text seen on the display. It is a modern yet approachable font.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img class="d-block w-100" src="./images/rubik.png">
        <br>
        <br>
        The <strong>“Source sans”</strong> was chosen for the main text seen throughout the application in order to provide extra
        sophistication over the “Rubik” font, while still remaining easy to read.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img class="d-block w-100" src="./images/sourcesans.png">
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Mockups</h2>
      <p>With the color palette and fonts styles finalized, we were finally able to move on to creating the mockups. The
        general feeling that we tried to evoke through the design was that of trust, collaboration, and welcoming.
        Therefore, we decided to design the application according to standard design guidelines, emulating the
        applications that use few colors such as Instagram, Facebook, Apple, etc. that our users would typically use. We
        decided to use our chosen colors to indicate actions, as the blue is a clear contrast and draws the attention of
        the user. For the general feel of the application we opted for rounded corners to remain consistent current
        applications available on the Appstore.
      </p>
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="./images/mockups/setup.png">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="./images/mockups/main.png">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="./images/mockups/settings.png">
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>A Few Design Details</h3>
      <p>There are certain details that we are unable to communicate through the mockups themselves. In terms of
        interaction, the list of offer cards are swipeable, such that the user can decide to swipe away an offer card,
        which the user will never see again. Moreover, the hamburger menu is a slide out panel, which makes it clear
        that the panel is present to the left side of the application and is reachable at any time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        Prototyping was the last step of our interaction design process.
        In this stage we can experience the full UI and UX design of our application.
        The typical user flow can be experienced with the prototype and goes as follows.
        For instance, from the offers page, the current prototype shows the expected behavior with the Nike offer.
        It also shows the search functionality, where a user might want to type in ‘Apple’ and select the Apple company
        offers.
        The prototype also shows the signup process, and the menu tab which allows for a consistent app navigation.
        Lastly, the prototype also shows the initial “profiling” process of the users, from establishing the user’s
        preferences to connecting their design platforms.
      </p>
      <iframe style="border: none;" width="700" height="800"
        src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F6cUN4jzKMlgGZuUQQzRCiV%2FShareSeed%3Fnode-id%3D24%253A58%26scaling%3Dscale-down"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        Two functionalities are not included in the prototype. The first is the ability to click on the RBC and Apple
        cards from the “My Offers” page, currently only the Nike card is functional.
        The second is the “account settings" menu item from the hamburger menu is not currently clickable, the real
        button would open a browser to lead to an accounts settings page on ShareSeed’s portal.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>This UX project offered an interesting perspective into the different points of view regarding data privacy and
        the potential for selling data. In terms of research, we were intrigued by the diverging opinions regarding the
        sale of user data, and we explored the reasons why. This allowed us to design an application that considered
        these perspectives, which was definitely more difficult than expected. It was fun to come up with an application
        that framed the opportunity of matching a buyer of data with a seller of data in such a way to protect the
        dignity of users. By framing the requests of data as offers for compensation in return for data, we flipped the
        topic on its head and appeased the concerns of the users. All in all, there were many details that we had to not
        overlook, and it was a great learning experience.</p>

        <span class="first-letter">C</span>omes out that nothing is better than a big first letter to super-charge your
        style.
        Rules are simples. A big letter that spans exactly two rows. Play with <code>line-height</code> to get it right.
      </p>
      <h2>The hero</h2>
      <p>We all know who the leader is.<br>When designing a website you have to take into account fonts for three
        sectors: the <strong>content</strong>, the <strong>UI</strong>, the <strong>brand</strong>.<br>Specifically I
        found that the best free alternatives <i>(Google Fonts)</i> to the handcrafted fonts that
        <strong>Medium</strong> uses are respectively <span class="highlighted">Lora</span>,
        <span class="highlighted">Montserrat</span> and <span class="highlighted">Playfair Display</span>. <br>I
        discovered with delight that the last one mimics almost perfectly the effect created especially for
        <code>blockquote</code>.
      </p>
      <h2>Content font</h2>
      <p>
        The content font should be a serif one, to gently bring your eyes from one letter to the other with
        the lowest amount of effort.<br><code>line-height</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code> are vital here. Play
        with those parameters to make the most out of your
        font of choice. However at <strong>Medium</strong> you'll find almost an empty line of space in the middle of
        two lines of text (<code>line-height: 1.58;</code>).
        While the space between the charachters is kept a little bit on the negative side
        (<code>letter-spacing: -0.03;</code>) to make words feel more compacts.
      </p>
      <h2>Brand font</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this font is to enforce the presence of our brand during the navigation experience.
        We can use it for titles and, here and there, for some minutiae.
      </p>
      <blockquote>Blockquotes, for example 🤫</blockquote>
      <h2>UI font</h2>
      <p>
        The font used for all the UI elements is preferably a sans-serif one. It should create contrast with the content
        font.
        Its color could be a little bit lighter than the one used for the main content. <br>It needs to be readable
        given the background-color of your page
        but not distracting from the main purpose of the page. <span class="highlighted">Reading!</span><br>You can use
        it also for <code>h2</code> making the titles for your paragraphs. Here the color should be the same as the one
        used for the main title.
      </p>
      <h2><span class="highlighted">The highlight</span></h2>
      <p>To highlight a word or phrase you can wrap them in a <code>span</code> element and <span
          class="highlighted">set the background to a color that reminds of your brand color identity</span>.</p>
      <h1>Every Title</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">`Needs a subtitle`</p>
      <p>Here we find <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)</code> to give meaningful informations without grabbing the attention
        that the title, main charachter, deserves.</p>
      <h2>The length</h2>
      <p class="lineLength">
        The length of a line of text should never be longer than <code>740px</code>. So our eyes are not forced to run
        from left to right on the page. </p>
      <h2>The color</h2>
      <p>
        The text color should be <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84)</code> on a <code>rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)</code> background to
        ensure the best contrast possible.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>As always, the strict first rule of design is that there are no strict rules.<br>But, if you are in trouble...
